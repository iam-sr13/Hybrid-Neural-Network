# Hybrid Neural Network
 and Hybrid Transfer Learning

Abstract- The aim of this research is to investigate whether 3rd gen Neural Networks can learn directly from 2nd gen Neural Networks. It is mainly focused on the theoretical aspects of the state of the art field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In this project, I am using Alexnet (a Deep Convolutional Neural Network) as a 2nd gen Neural Network and Spiking Deep Belief Network (a Spiking Neural Network) as a 3rd gen Neural Network. MATLAB environment is used to simulate the same and MNIST dataset as base for evaluating the proposed Hybrid Neural Network of 2nd and 3rd gen Neural Networks.

First, I would explain the specifics of SDBN and Alexnet used in this project. I will also discuss their potential applications in general. And then we will design and implement a Hybrid Neural Network and find out whether direct transfer learning is possible among two different architectures of Neural Networks.

I will be showing that HTL is possible, and in fact the Spiking Neural Networks can actually benefit from the Deep Neural Networks as per the results obtained.

The result of this work is the realization of the Hybrid Transfer Learning algorithm, fusion of Deep Learning with the Spiking Neurons in MATLAB environment, as well as the ability to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database.
